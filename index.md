## Stephen Aigner's Github Profile

Hello Everyone!

My name is Stephen and I am a 4th year undergrad student at San Diego University. I am studying statistics with an emphasis in Actuarial Science. I am currently enrolled in GEOG 594, a big data analytics class. After graduation I aspire to work as a data analyst in either the biopharma or tech industry. 


Below is a data set that I am interested in:
https://www.internationalgenome.org/data

This data set is the international genome sample resource. It has many applications in the genetic sequencing field and biotech industry as a whole. 

Also, below is a book relating to data science that was recommended:
http://www.getty.edu/research/publications/electronic_publications/intrometadata/index.html

This book, Introduction to Metadata, interests me because I desire to learn more about the different types of metadata. It would be useful to learn more about the different organization levels of data and what classifies as metadata.
